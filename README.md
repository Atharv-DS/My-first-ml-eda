Used a linear regression model to predict the prices of California houses

This project shows how I used a linear regression model from scikit-learn to predict the prices of California houses

# overview
 Used pandas to read the data and get an breif info about it.
 Used Scikit-Learn to split the data into training and testing , trained the data and predicted the values using the training data.
 Calculated the difference in the predicted and actual values again using Scikit-Learn.
 Used Matplotlib to plot a scatter graph using actual and predicted values.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the classic [California Housing Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#california-housing-dataset) available via [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing.html).  
It includes features such as:
- Median income
- Average number of rooms
- Population
- Latitude and longitude
- ...and more
